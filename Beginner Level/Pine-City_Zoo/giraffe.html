          <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
          <p>The giraffe is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is known for its long neck and legs, which allow it to reach high foliage.</p>
          <p>Giraffes are social animals that live in groups called towers. They are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees.</p>
          <p><strong>Where will you find it?</strong></p>
          <p>The giraffe exhibit is located in the African section of the zoo, near the lion enclosure. You can observe them from the viewing platform that offers a great view of their habitat.</p>
          <p>Don't miss the giraffe feeding session at 11 AM daily, where you can get up close and personal with these gentle giants!</p>
