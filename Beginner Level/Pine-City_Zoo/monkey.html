          <h3>MONKEY</h3>
          <p>Monkeys are primates that are known for their intelligence and playful behavior. They are found in various habitats around the world, from tropical rainforests to savannas.</p>
          <p>Monkeys are social animals and often live in groups called troops. They communicate with each other through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language.</p>
          <p><strong>Where will you find it?</strong></p>
          <p>The monkey exhibit is located in the tropical section of the zoo, near the bird aviary. You can observe them swinging from branches and playing with each other.</p>
          <p>Don't miss the monkey feeding session at 10 AM daily, where you can see them interact with their keepers and enjoy their favorite fruits!</p>
